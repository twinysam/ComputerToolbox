# Computer Toolbox

My software essentials, the handy tools, the things that make my life easier and/or more enjoyable. Mostly Windows-oriented, but plenty of open source and cross-platform software in there.

In no particular order:

* [LightShot](https://app.prntscr.com/en/index.html) - Taking screenshots made easy. Windows and Mac.
* [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) - Coding for the web. I also like [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but this one is my favorite. Cross-platform.
* [foobar2000](http://www.foobar2000.org/) - My favorite audio playback software for Windows. Extremely customizable. 
* [SpeedCrunch](https://speedcrunch.org/) - Hands down the best calculator I've ever used. Cross-platform.
* [Network Lights](http://www.itsamples.com/network-lights.html) - Can turn that useless scroll-lock light on your desktop keyboard, into a network connection traffic indicator. Especially useful if your modem is not on sight. Windows only.
* [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) - My favorite video player and the best one out there. If you are still using Windows Media Player or iTunes, you are missing out on life. Cross-platform.
* [Notepad2](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html) - The best replacement for Windows default notepad. It can fully replace it in the installation. It highlights code, has soft-wrapping, character counter, and many more features. Plus it is highly customizable.
* [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) - Once upon a time uTorrent was the shit, but then it turned to shit (full of ads and spyware). This is open source and keeps getting better. For all your torrenting needs. Cross-platform.
* [ResophNotes](http://www.resoph.com/ResophNotes/Welcome.html) - Notes are an essential part of my life and this windows app is the fastest, most handy and lightweight I've come across. I also like [Notation](https://www.getnotation.com/) and the native [SimpleNote app](https://simplenote.com/). But ResophNotes has earned a solid spot on my day-to-day.
* [Feed Notifier](https://www.feednotifier.com/) - Simple desktop feed notifications. I've been looking for something like this for ages. Simple RSS notifications without the need for a fully fleshed feed manager/reader. Ideal to stay on top of news (ie: adding only a handful of feeds).
* [Sumatra PDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html) - The best alternative to Adobe Acrobat. Lightweight and supporting all sorts of formats.
* [Handbreak](https://handbrake.fr/) - Video transcoding made easy. Cross-platform.
* [WriteMonkey](http://writemonkey.com/) - One of my favorite distraction-free writing software. I've been using it for years now. Windows.
* [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) - Pixel art for the 21st century. Good for icons, GIFs and your basic Paint needs. Incredibly powerful.
* [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) - For all your e-book needs. Cross-platform.
* [CDisplay EX](http://www.cdisplayex.com/) - For reading CBR comicbook files.
