My software essentials, the handy tools, the things that make my life easier and/or more enjoyable. Mostly Windows-oriented, but plenty of open source and cross-platform software in there.

In no particular order:

- [LocalSend](https://github.com/localsend/localsend) - A god send, THE god send. Send files wirelessly from device to device without needing to upload it to the cloud. Cross-platform.
- [Flow Launcher](https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher) - A nifty launch/search bar for Windows. Very nifty.
- [Notesnook](https://github.com/streetwriters/notesnook) - I tried almost every (non-Mac exclusive) note-taking software under the sun and I'm really liking this one, very fast and feature rich. Cross-platform.
- [Ludo](https://github.com/libretro/ludo) - For when you want to play some retro games without wanting to get deep into the weeds of setting up RetroArch and stuff.
- [LosslessCut](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut) - I use this pretty often to losslessly edit videos. Super lightweight and fast. Cross-platform.
- [LightShot](https://app.prntscr.com/en/index.html) - Taking screenshots made easy. Windows and Mac.
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - My go-to note taking app for the last few years, also a very solid code editor but I still mainly use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for actual coding. Cross-platform.
- [foobar2000](http://www.foobar2000.org/) - My favorite audio playback software for Windows. Extremely customizable.
- [SpeedCrunch](https://speedcrunch.org/) - Hands down the best software calculator I've ever used. Cross-platform.
- [PeaCalc](https://github.com/JdSchlachter/PeaCalc/) - This one is WAY more lightweight and faster than SpeedCrunch, but not as pretty and can't really be customized. Windows only.
- [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) - Who doesn't know this one by now? THE best video player full stop. Cross-platform.
- [Notepad2e](https://github.com/ProgerXP/Notepad2e) - The best replacement for Windows default notepad. It can fully replace it in the installation. It highlights code, has soft-wrapping, character counter, and many more features. Plus it is highly customizable.
- [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) - Once upon a time uTorrent was the shit, but then it turned to shit (full of ads and spyware). This is open source and keeps getting better. For all your torrenting needs. Cross-platform.
- [Feed Notifier](https://github.com/fogleman/FeedNotifier) - Simple desktop feed notifications. I've been looking for something like this for ages. Simple RSS notifications without the need for a fully fleshed feed manager/reader. Ideal to stay on top of news (ie: adding only a handful of feeds).
- [Sumatra PDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html) - The best alternative to Adobe Reader. Lightweight and supporting all sorts of formats.
- [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/) - Video transcoding made easy. Cross-platform.
- [CDisplay EX](http://www.cdisplayex.com/) - For reading CBR comicbook files.
- [Ghostwriter](https://wereturtle.github.io/ghostwriter/) - Another great distraction-free writing tool. This one is open source and is named like [that awesome show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewRAVRgPngg).
- [Mem Reduct](https://github.com/henrypp/memreduct) - Tool to keep track of RAM on Windows and reduce it if needed. Very handy.
